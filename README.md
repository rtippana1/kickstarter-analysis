# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project is to help Louise plan her own crowdfunding campaign to fund her play fever.Excel has been used to analyze the Crowdfunding data to determine if there are any specific patterns which would help in making a projects campaign successful,And also help her gain grater understanding of campaigns from start to finish and will be able to set her campaign to mirror other successful once in the same category.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to provide Louise with analysis of how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
May is a good time to start a crowdfunding campaign and a goal of less than 1000 would fetch higher success rate.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The most successful Kickstarter campaigns were started in May. On the other hand, December doesn't seem like a great time to launch a campaign.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The most successful Kickstarter campaigns have their goals less than 1000. And campaigns whose goals are between 45000 to 49999 have 10o% failed.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- The most successful Kickstarter campaigns were started in May.

- The most successful Kickstarter campaigns have their goals less than 1000.

- There are some large funding goals in the dataset, which are outliers for the analysis that are for theater-building proposals. Louise just wants funding for her play, not a theater.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
